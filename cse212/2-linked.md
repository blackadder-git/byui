# Linked Lists
## Introduction
Unlike other data structures which store their information in contiguous memory, a linked list stores its information as a series of nodes that can reside anywhere. Each node is linked together to for a series or a chain. The first node in the list is referred to as the "**head**" while the last node in the list is referred to as the "**tail**".

*While most linked lists are bi-directional like the image above, it is possible to have a linked list that goes in just one direction.

## Performance (Big O Notation)
The performance of a linked list depends on the action being taken. The size of a list makes no difference when adding a node to the beginning or ending. This results in a big O notation of O(1). When adding, removing or searching for for a specific node in the list, the time required to reach the desired node increases linearly as the size of the list grows bigger. This results in a notation of O(n).

## Used For
* Linked lists are a good underlying data structure to implment a stack or a queue because they offer efficient insertion and removal of elements.
* 

## Disadvantages
Because linked lists hold data along with information to reach the next node, they have the potential to take more space to implement. In addition, since getting from one node to another often means moving to a new location in memory, linked lists canÂ´t take advantage of caching.

## Example: 
TODO: describe example

```
# create a linked list class
class LinkedList:
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, data):
            # initialize new node
            self.data = data
            self.next = None
            self.prev = None

    def __init__(self):
        # initialize empty list
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
```

When adding a node to the beginning of the list, the previous link of the former head is pointed forward to the new node and the next link of the new head is pointed to the previuos head. The previous link of the new head remains null.

```
    # add to beginning of list
    def insert_head(self, value):
        # add head node
        new_node = LinkedList.Node(value)  
        
        # if head is empty, set as new node
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        else:
            # otherwise, point new node (next) to old head 
            new_node.next = self.head
            # point old head (prev) to new node
            self.head.prev = new_node
            # set new head
            self.head = new_node
```

When adding a node to the end of the list, the next link of the former tail is pointed back to the new node and the previous link of the new tail is pointed back to the previuos node. The next link of the new tail remains null.

```
    # add to end of list
    def insert_tail(self, value):
        # add tail node
        new_node = LinkedList.Node(value)

        # if tail is empty, set as new node
        if self.tail is None:
            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        else :
           # otherwise, point old tail (next) to new node
            self.tail.next = new_node
            # point new tail (prev) to old tail
            new_node.prev = self.tail
            # set new tail
            self.tail = new_node
```

To insert a value after a match, the following function points the next link of the previous node to the new node. Likewise, it points the previous link of the previous node back to the new node. The next and previous links of the new node are added and the new node is inserted into the list.
```
    # insert node after matching value
    def insert_after(self, value, new_value):
        # search list for match, insert after if found
        curr = self.head
        while curr is not None:
            if curr.data == value:
                # match at end, insert new tail
                if curr == self.tail:
                    self.insert_tail(new_value)
                else:
                    # create new node
                    new_node = LinkedList.Node(new_value)
                    # point new node to previous node
                    new_node.prev = curr
                    # point new node to next node
                    new_node.next = curr.next
                    # point 
                    curr.next.prev = new_node
                    # point next node back to the new node
                    curr.next = new_node
                # return after adding node
                return
            curr = curr.next # Go to the next node to search for 'value'
```

To remove a node from the list, the previous and next links of the surrounding nodes are reset to point around the node that is to be removed.
```
    # remove matching node
    def remove(self, value):
        curr = self.head
        while curr is not None:
            if curr.data == value:
                # if the node is the head, remove the first item in the list
                if curr == self.head:
                    self.remove_head()
                # if the node is the tail, remove the last item in the list
                elif curr == self.tail:
                    self.remove_tail()
                else :
                    # change 
                    # set the previous node to point to the next node (and skip the current node)
                    curr.prev.next = curr.next
                    # set the next node to point to the previous node (and skip the current node)
                    curr.next.prev = curr.prev
                # the node was removed
                return
            curr = curr.next # Go to the next node to search for 'value'

    # iterate linked list
    def __iter__(self):
        curr = self.head  # Start at the begining since this is a forward iteration.
        while curr is not None:
            # store up values, return all at once
            yield curr.data
            # traverse list
            curr = curr.next

```

Write out list
```
    # turn list into string
    def __str__(self):
        output = "linkedlist["
        first = True
        for value in self:
            if first:
                first = False
            else:
                output += ", "
            output += str(value)
        output += "]"
        return output
```

Test out the list
```
# create list
linkedlist = LinkedList()
linkedlist.insert_head(1)
linkedlist.insert_tail(3)
linkedlist.insert_after(1, 2)
print(linkedlist)
```

Output:
```
linkedlist[1, 2, 3]
```
