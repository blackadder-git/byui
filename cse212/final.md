# Stacks
## Introduction

## Performance (big O notation)

## Used for
+ Functions that implement backtracking often use a stack to return to some previous decision point and try an alternate path. 
+ Likewise, when a program has an undo function, it is most likely using a stack to track changes in order to revert to some previous state.
## Common errors
Stacks are susceptable to overflow meaning there is no longer space to contain more data. This can happen unintentionally when a recursive function calls itself too many times. It can also happen if a the data given to a stack is too large.

## Example: Notes in reverse
