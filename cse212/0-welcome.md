# Data Structures Tutorial

Learning to program requires learning to use various data structures. In this tutorial, the following three structures are discussed.

+ [Stacks](1-stacks.md)
+ [Linked Lists](2-linked.md)
+ [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module of the tutorial contains a definition, performance information, use cases, disadvantages and an example. At the end of each module, there is a problem to solve. Do not look at the solution until after you have tried to solve the problem.
