# Stacks
## Introduction
Stacks are characterized as "**Last In, First Out**" data structures. Items put or "**pushed**" onto the top or "**back**" of the stack canÂ´t be removed until other more recent elements have been taken or "**popped**" off.

+ Element 1 is pushed onto an empty stack
+ Element 2 is pushed onto element 1
+ Element 3 is then pushed onto element 2
+ Finally, element 3 is popped off the stack

## Performance (Big O Notation)
The performance of a stack depends on how it is implemented. 

If the underlying data structure uses an array or list to add and remove elements, it has O(n) notation. This reflects the linear nature of how growing the data set also increases time required by the algorithm to process elements in the array. Likewise, as the size of the structure increases, performance degrades since more and more items need to be copied and moved. 

If on the other hand, the structure uses a linked list to add and remove items from the stack, performance is constant with O(1) notation and does not decrease as the structure increases.

## Used For
+ Functions that implement backtracking often use stacks to return to previous decision points thereby allowing a program to try an alternate path. 
+ Likewise, when a program has an undo function, it is most likely using a stack to track and revert changes back to some previous state.

## Disadvantages
Stacks are susceptible to overflow if there is no more space. This can happen unintentionally when a recursive function calls itself too many times. It can also happen if the data given to a stack is too large for the stack to hold.

## Example: 
In this example, a Python list is used to implement a stack that follows the principle of **"Last In, First Out"**. Although other implementations might use a deque or linked list to do this, this example uses a list. Also, to improve performance, the stack adds and removes items from the end of the list and not the beginning.

```
# create a stack class
class Stack:
  def __init__(self):
    # use a list to hold items
    self.__index = []

  # return number of items in the stack
  def __len__(self):
    return len(self.__index)

  # add item to the end of the stack
  def push(self,item):
    self.__index.append(item)

  # get item from the back of the stack
  def pop(self):
    if len(self) == 0:
       return "pop() called on empty stack."
    else:
        return self.__index.pop()
```

Test out the stack
```
# instantiate a stack object
pancake = Stack()

# add items
pancake.push(1) # bottom
pancake.push(2) # middle
pancake.push(3) # top

# remove items
# the first pancake added is the last one eaten
print("Eat: " + str(pancake.pop()))
print("Eat: " + str(pancake.pop()))
print("Eat: " + str(pancake.pop()))
# time to make more pancakes
print("Eat: " + str(pancake.pop()))
```

Output:
```
Eat: 3
Eat: 2
Eat: 1
Eat: pop() called on empty stack.
```
## Problem to Solve: Notes in Reverse

While the good Doctor Frankenstein is away, trusty Igor has been tasked with transcribing the doctor's secret notebook into something more ledgible. Always one to please, Igor needs your help to write a program before the doctor returns.

+ Use a stack to reverse the letters of the following message

```

```
 
+ **Hint:** to work correctly, try adding and removing each letter of the message to and from the stack on its own
