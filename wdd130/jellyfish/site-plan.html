      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <h4>Who are our customers?</h4>
      <p>
        Our customers are small to large teams, families, and all those who seek
        for treasure. Our customers range from age 12 to 75; male and female
        alike.
      </p>

      <h4>What do they want?</h4>
      <p>
        Our customers want adventure. When they book a tour with Pirate Oar
        Rafting they generally show up dressed as a pirate. Think escape room
        only on the water. Using our patented 150 question survey, we tailor
        each experience to fit the needs of the individual group.
      </p>

      <h4>What are their needs and wants?</h4>
      <p>
        Our customers need to know 1. types of tours that are available, 2. what
        makes our tours different 3. where we operate and how to contact us.
        They also want information on package pricing, equipment and assurances
        that their experience with us will be safe.
      </p>

      <h4>How will the audience access the site?</h4>
      <p>
        Pre-adventure, customers will access our site via their desktop. During
        the trip however, they will access our site via their mobile devices.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
        in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
        above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
        child pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
        be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
        global navigation for the site.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6 sections to our page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain
          means an image) and the navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>
          Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
          icons.
        </li>
      </ol>
