      <h1>The Wonderful World of Credits</h1>

      <!--
      <h2>How does the United States educational system compare to other parts of the world?</h2>

      <p>
        In the US, students in highschool normally take a standardized test called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT">SAT</a>
        The score they earn is used by universities to accept or reject their university application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, in Spain, students that want to attend university take an exam called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectividad">EBAU</a>
        The score they earn is used by universities not only to determine whether or not a student can attend a university but also 
        to limit the type of degree they may earn based on the score they got.  Higher score = more possibilities.
      </p>

      <h2>BYU-Pathway Worldwide simplifies this process and offers two ways to begin the program.</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The <a href="https://www.byupathway.org/admissions/application-process#preferred-path">Preferred path</a> doesn´t require any admission
          test beyond English. Of course, we all know PC101 and PC102 contain plenty of math and writing :)
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a href="https://www.byupathway.org/admissions/application-process#advanced-path">Advanced path</a> on the other hand requires
          test scores and is primarily meant for US students with university experience. It´s also more expensive.
        </li>
      </ul>


      Ecclesiastical Endoresement

      I have submitted my part of the endorsement online but my bishop does not see my name in his ward queue. Why?
      He most likely is going to the wrong website. He will need to access at the following: web.byui.edu/endorseleader

      <h2>Imagine if BYU-Idaho made Pizza ...</h2>

      <p>
        Credits are like the ingredients you put on pizza. Not all are the same.
        Some take longer to cook or chew. And some are more expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a class worth 3 credits costs more than a class worth 1
        credit. Likewise, a 4 credit class requires more time and effort to
        complete than a 1 credit class. Classes at BYU-Idaho range from 1 to 4
        credits each.

        Currently on the menu at BYU-Idaho, you can earn:

      <h2><a name="1cert">Your First Certificate</a></h2>

      <p>
        Consider Mary who has decided to earn her
        <strong
          >Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) certificate</strong
        >. If her certificate looked like a slice of pizza, it would look like
        this.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>1st certificate (7 classes, 16 credits)</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The green peppers, tomato and mushrooms represent the number of classes
        Mary needs to take. In total, she needs 7. Notice, however, the classes
        are worth different amounts of credit. Together, her 7 classes are worth
        16 credits.
      </p>

      <p>
        During her Pathway program, Mary took an institute class + one or two
        other classes for a total of 5 credits per semester x 3 semesters. She
        has already earned 14-16 credits. While She was limited to how many
        classes she could take at BYU-Pathway, at BYU-Idaho she can take up to
        <a

          >21 credits</a
        >
        per semester. Note: During the year there are 3 semesters (Fall, Winter,
        Spring).

      <h2><a name="2cert">Your Second Certificate</a></h2>

      <p>
        Wanting more, Mary decides to earn a
        <strong>Computer Programming certificate</strong>.
      </p>

      <img

        <strong
          >1st certificate + 2nd certificate (5 classes, 15 credits)</strong
        >
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        While the second certificate still has some 2 and 3 credit classes, it
        also has a 4 credit class. This time, Mary ends up taking 5 classes
        worth a total of 15 credits.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="associate">Associate Degree</a></h2>

      <p>
        Once Mary has her second certificate, with a few more classes she can
        get an <strong>Associate of Professional Studies</strong> degree. Note:
        Other degrees are available depending on the certificates you earn.
      </p>

      <img

          9 electives)</strong
        >
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        To do this, Mary needs to earn 18 general education credits
        (<strong>pepperoni</strong>) and 9 elective credits
        (<strong>onion</strong>).
      </p>

      <table border="1">

            General education courses are typically designed to teach diverse

            art, etc)
          </td>
          <td>
            Elective classes in college are courses that count towards your
            total credits, but are not required by your degree.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        If a class on average equals 3 credits, that means Mary needs about 6 GE
        classes and 3 electives. Luckily, she can use some or all of the 15
        credits she earned in BYU-Pathway.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="3cert">The Third Certificate</a></h2>

      <p>
        Can you believe, after two certificates and an associates degree, Mary
        is still hungry! She decides to earn a
        <strong>Marriage and Family certificate</strong>. Now her academic pizza
        looks like this.
      </p>

          certificate (5 classes, 15 credits)</strong

      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Notice how the 3rd certificate is also 15 credits yet it is made up
        entirely of 3 credit classes.
      </p>

      />

      <h2><a name="bachelor">Bachelor´s Degree</a></h2>

      <p>
        Once Mary has eaten her third certificate, she can finish her meal and
        order a <strong>Bachelor´s of Professional Studies</strong> degree.
      </p>

      <img

      <p>
        Besides the additional certificate, the only other requirement is that
        she earn additional general education credits and more electives for a
        total of about 13 or 14 more classes.
      </p>

      <h2>Other Degrees</h2>
      <p>
        In some cases, a bachelor´s degree may also require a senior project
        <strong>(basil)</strong> or an internship <strong>(olive)</strong>.

      <h2>In the end, Mary will leave BYU-Idaho with:</h2>

        <li>A certificate (TEFL)</li>
        <li>A 2nd certificate (Programming)</li>

          Friends. So many friends. Seriously, networking can be as important
          and in some cases more important than the eventual degrees you earn :)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>So, how long will all this take?</h2>

      <p>
        It all depends on how fast Mary can eat :) Does she work, does she have
        a family to take care of, is she traveling, does she have money to pay
        for each credit, etc?
      </p>

      <p>BYU-Idaho recommends 16 credits hours for full time students.</p>

      <p>
        The credits assigned to a class identify both it´s cost in money as well
        as the number of hours one should expect to spend each week to do well.
        I´ve heard it said we should plan to spend 3 hours per credit per week
        outside of class. Of course the time required will vary greatly from one
        student to the next. But in general, a 3 credit class requres about 9
        hours of effort per week to do well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Personally, I have used the

          >degree list</a
        >
        page as a good starting point to plan out my academic future.

      <h2>Bon Appetite</h2>
      <p>
        In 1956, during his talk called "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/hugh-b-brown/education-part-salvation/">Education is a Part of Salvation</a>",
        President Hugh B. Brown said, "A man cannot be saved in ignorance; your learning is part of your salvation. Do not become complacent with your knowledge but seek education continually".
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a great task in front of us, I believe that the effort we spend
        in this cause is worthwhile and we will reap the fruit thereof.
      </p>

      <p>Good luck, and get your pizza while it´s still hot.</p>
