          <h1>Once upon a time ...</h1>  
          <p>
            Once upon a time there was a wood-cutter in Ireland. He had one
            daughter named Nuala and she was very beautiful. Several times there
            came Kingly men to take her away but she would not go with them.
            There were dwarfs who came also and one day the Prince was to visit
            her and the father. Nuala went away to a wood and sat there but
            while she was sitting she heard sweet music. She looked around but
            could see nothing only a little frog which sat beside her. The
            little creature told her to follow the music and she did as she was
            told. When she came to the end of the music she found herself at a
            river and there was a boat waiting for her. She went into it and in
            the end she found herself at a castle. There were lovely gates which
            led her to the castle and Nuala was singing. There were dragons at
            the gates and when they heard the lovely singing they opened the
            gates and let her in. She was put into a beautiful room all
            ornamented with mirrors. Nuala forgot all about her father and the
            Prince that was to visit her. She told dwarfs about her father and
            the Prince that was to visit her. The dwarfs said that there would
            be many a grey hair in her fathers head and that he would weep many
            a tear before her father would see his beautiful daughter again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile the Prince came and her told him that she was away with
            the dwarfs. The Prince got a horse and went riding on him and he
            went away through the woods. When he was going through the wood he
            met a witch and she gave him a cap. The witch said for him to put on
            the cap and that no person could put him out of the castle. He gave
            him a bridle and a sword and told him to put the bridle on the horse
            and she would go swifter than the wind. He went to the castle and
            got Nuala home with him. Nuala and the Prince were married and there
            were many a grey hair and they wept many tears before the dwarfs
            ever saw the Prince again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now this wood was supposed to have been in the present town-land of
            Doohill, which means in Irish Dubh-choill, and the remains of it are
            still to be seen on the south side of the town-land on both sides of
            the road passing from Woodhill to Drimnacrosh.
