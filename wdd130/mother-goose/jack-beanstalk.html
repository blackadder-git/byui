          <h1>Once upon a time ...</h1>  
          <p>
            Jack, a poor country boy, trades the family cow for a handful of
            magic beans, which grow into an enormous beanstalk reaching up into
            the clouds. Jack climbs the beanstalk and finds himself in the
            castle of an unfriendly giant. The giant senses Jack's presence and
            cries, Fee-fi-fo-fum! I smell the blood of an English man. Be he
            alive, or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread.
            Outwitting the giant, Jack is able to retrieve many goods once
            stolen from his family, including a bag of gold, an enchanted goose
            that lays golden eggs and a magic golden harp that plays and sings
            by itself. Jack then escapes by chopping down the beanstalk. The
            giant, who is pursuing him, falls to his death, and Jack and his
            family prosper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many modern interpretations have made the giant a villain,
            terrorizing smaller folk and stealing from them, so that Jack
            becomes a legitimate protagonist. For example, the giant is blamed
            for poverty at the foot of the beanstalk, as he has been stealing
            food and wealth and the hen that lays golden eggs originally
            belonged to Jack's family. In other versions, it is implied that the
            giant had stolen both the hen and the harp from Jack's father.
