      <h1>Mother Goose</h1>
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered where the three little pigs got their building
        permits or if the wolf that ate the seven little lambs was also the wolf
        that ate Red Riding Hood's grandmother? We deserve answers. It is time
        to shed light on these mysteries and fill in the missing pieces of the
        Mother Goose conspiracy.

              In order to appear superior, a miller lies to the king, telling
              him that his daughter can spin straw into gold. The king calls for
              the girl, shuts her in a tower room filled with straw and a
              spinning wheel, and demands she spin the straw into gold by
              morning or he will cut off her head. When she has given up all
              hope, an imp-like creature appears in the room and

              magic beans, which grow into an enormous beanstalk reaching up
              into the clouds. Jack climbs the beanstalk and finds himself in
              the castle of an unfriendly giant. The giant senses Jack's
              presence and cries, Fee-fi-fo-fum! I smell the blood of an English

              There was once a most beautiful and amiable princess who was
              called “The Fair One with Locks of Gold,” for her hair shone
              brighter than gold, and flowed in curls down to her feet, her head
              was always encircled by a wreath of beautiful flowers, and pearls
              and diamonds. A handsome, rich, young prince, whose territories
              joined to hers, was deeply in love

              for her in exchange for her friendship. The Frog Prince, who is
              under a witch's curse, magically transforms back into a handsome
              prince. The frog's spell was broken when the princess threw it

              approaches Little Red Riding Hood, who naively tells him where she

              A king and queen had a beautiful daughter, Graciosa, and an ugly

              much that his doctors ordered him to hunt. Weary, he stopped at
              the duchess's castle and discovered how rich she was. He agreed to
              marry her even though she demanded control of her stepdaughter.

              flower. He does not know, however, which flower he should choose
              as his bride. Knowing that people use daisies to tell their
              fortunes, pulling off the petals while saying, "He loves me. He
              loves me not", the butterfly concludes that daisies must be able
              to see into the future. In order to save time
