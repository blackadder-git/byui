      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered where the three little pigs got their building
        permits or if the wolf that ate the seven little lambs was also the wolf
        that ate Red Riding Hood´s grandmother? We deserve answers. And now is
        the right time to shed light on these mysteries. As a computer
        programmer who loves mythology, fables and fairy tales, my website will
        collect the information we need to fill in the missing pieces of this
        Mother Goose conspiracy. Would you like to sign up and become part of
        the truth?
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My target audience is Generation X; men and women born between 1965 and
        1980. My audience grew up during a time of increasing divorce rates, the
        crack and AIDs epidemic, the 1987 stock market crash and 1990´s recover.
        They also saw the birth of the PC and internet. Generation X is largely
        autonomous and pessimistic. 65 percent work full-time yet 70 percent
        don´t know if Social Security will be there when they retire. 74 percent
        bank online. 82 percent are homeowners. 95 percent have a Facebook page,
        35 percent a LinkedIn profile and 25 percent regularly post to Twitter.

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Henny Penny
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this font because it has a very Hansel and Gretal feel to it. I
        want users to imagine gingerbread and candy, witches and wolves as they
        browse the site. This font helps to achieve that.

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Open Sans
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this font because it contrasts nicely with the heading acting as
        the Dana Scully to the headings Fox Mulder. This font brings order and
        clarity to the text within each paragraph.

        First Letter Paragraph Font: Ballet
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this font because I wanted to decorate the beginning letter of
        each content paragraph. This font does that nicely.

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        Evil Queens in dazzling forests on the magic prince lazily saw a couple
        Ginger Bread Men. The fairies in a few princes somewhere bite a fast
        ogre. A couple elegant Rapunzels quickly ran a delightful ogre. A brave
        apple of the tiara quite dreams small apples. An apple wishfully sees a
        witty Cinderella. A happy Fairy God Mother in those Big Bad Wolves in a
        wonderful Aladdin briskly rode those curses. A dwarf in beanstalks there
        shows those Fairy God Mothers.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        The ogre rather sleeps the elegant Cinderellas. Some witty apples of Big
        Bad Wolves in big Snow Whites briskly cooked the curse. Fairy God
        Mothers briskly sang a forest. A forest on some wonderful Ginger Bread
        Men quickly goes the elegant Dumbos. The Big Bad Wolf happily found a
        happy Dumbo.

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Why will people come to my site?</strong><br />
        I expect people will come to my website initially out of curiosity.
        While most people are familiar with fairy tales, fables and nursery
        rhymes the idea that these stories also contain Easter eggs will be
        attractive to my target audience which is already a cynical generation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This part of the site will be styled with elements similar to the FBI's
        most wanted page. Only in place of individuals, I will focus on stories
        rather than specific individuals.

        ><br />
        First and foremost, the visitors to my site will want 1. to re-read and
        remember the stories they heard growing up. 2. Then, in much the same
        way the case was made that the Pixar movies have all taken place in the
        same universe, so too will my audience want to learn the connections
        that tie together their childhood memories. 3. Once the links are
        established, my audience will be ready to peel off another layer of the
        onion and learn why the conspiracy exists in the first place.

        <strong>Pertinent Information</strong><br />
        The site will contain text and analysis for many of the following
        nursery rhymes:
      </p>

      <pre>
    Humpty Dumpty Sat on a Wall
      Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
      Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
      All the king’s horses and all the king’s men
      Couldn’t put Humpty together again. 
  
    Jack and Jill
      Jack and Jill went up the hill
      To fetch a pail of water.
      Jack fell down and broke his crown,
      And Jill came tumbling after.

    Jack be Nimble
      Jack be nimble,
      Jack be quick,
      Jack jump over
      The candlestick. 

    Little Bo Peep
      Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep,
      And can’t tell where to find them;
      Leave them alone, and they’ll come home,
      Wagging their tails behind them. 

    Little Boy Blue
      Little Boy Blue,
      Come blow your horn;
      The sheep’s in the meadow,
      The cow’s in the corn.
      Where’s the little boy
      That looks after the sheep?
      He's under the haystack,
      fast a-sleep.

    Little Jack Horner
      Little Jack Horner
      Sat in the corner,
      Eating a Christmas pie;
      He put in his thumb,
      And pulled out a plum,
      And said “What a good boy am I!” 

    Little Miss Muffet
      Little Miss Muffet
      Sat on a tuffet,
      Eating her curds and whey;
      Along came a spider,
      Who sat down beside her
      And frightened Miss Muffet away. 

    London Bridge is Falling Down
      London Bridge is falling down,
      Falling down, falling down.
      London Bridge is falling down,
      My fair lady. 

    Mary Had a Little Lamb
      Mary had a little lamb,
      whose fleece was white as snow.
      And everywhere that Mary went,
      Mary went, Mary went,
      and everywhere that Mary went,
      the lamb was sure to go.

    Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary
      Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
      How does your garden grow?
      With silver bells, and cockle shells,
      And pretty maids all in a row. 

    Old King Cole
      Old King Cole was a merry old soul
      And a merry old soul was he;
      He called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl
      And he called for his fiddlers three. 

    Old Mother Hubbard
      Old Mother Hubbard
      Went to the cupboard
      To get her poor dog a bone,
      When she got there
      The cupboard was bare
      So the poor dog had none. 

    Peter, Peter Pumpkin Eater
      Peter, Peter pumpkin eater,
      Had a wife but couldn't keep her;
      He put her in a pumpkin shell
      And there he kept her well. 

    Ring Around the Rosy
      Ring around the rosy
      A pocketful of posies
      Ashes, Ashes,

    Rock-a-bye Baby
      Rock-a-bye baby, on the treetops,
      When the wind blows, the cradle will rock,
      When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall,
      And down will come baby, cradle and all.                

    Sing a Song of Six Pence
      Sing a song of sixpence,
      A pocket full of rye,
      Four and twenty blackbirds
      Baked in a pie.

      When the pie was opened
      The birds began to sing—
      Wasn't that a dainty dish
      To set before the king?

      The king was in the counting-house
      Counting out his money,
      The queen was in the parlor
      Eating bread and honey,

      The maid was in the garden
      Hanging out the clothes.
      Along came a blackbird
      And snipped off her nose.

    There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe
      There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.
      She had so many children, she didn't know what to do;
      She gave them some broth without any bread;
      Then whipped them all soundly and put them to bed. 

    Three Blind Mice
      Three blind mice. Three blind mice.
      See how they run. See how they run.
      They all ran after the farmer's wife,
      Who cut off their tails with a carving knife,
      Did you ever see such a sight in your life,
      As three blind mice?

        I´m also toying with the idea of using a table with the same number of
        columns and rows. Something like a travel map that lets you find the
        distance between two cities. Only in this case I´ll show the
        intersections of the different stories that are listed on the front
        page. I may precede this section with something like a crime board that
        shows a mysterious Mother Goose at the center and strings drawn out to
        push pins pinned to photos of other characters of interest.
