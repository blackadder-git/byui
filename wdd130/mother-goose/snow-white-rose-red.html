          <h1>Once upon a time ...</h1>  
          <p>
            Snow-White and Rose-Red are two little girls living with their
            mother, a poor widow, in a small cottage by the woods. Fair-haired
            Snow-White is quiet and shy and prefers to spend her time indoors,
            doing housework and reading. Dark-haired Rose-Red is outspoken,
            lively and cheerful, and prefers to be outside. They are both very
            good girls who love each other and their mother dearly, and their
            mother is very fond of them as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            One winter night, there is a knock at the door. Rose-Red opens the
            door to find a bear. At first, she is terrified, but the bear tells
            her not to be afraid. "I'm half frozen and I merely want to warm up
            a little at your place," he says. They let the bear in, and he lies
            down in front of the fire. Snow-White and Rose-Red beat the snow off
            the bear, and they quickly become quite friendly with him. They play
            with the bear and roll him around playfully. They let the bear spend
            the night in front of the fire. In the morning, he leaves trotting
            out into the woods. The bear comes back every night for the rest of
            that winter and the family grows used to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            When summer comes, the bear tells them that he must go away for a
            while to guard his treasure from a wicked dwarf. During the summer,
            when the girls are walking through the forest, they find a dwarf
            whose beard is stuck in a tree. The girls rescue him by cutting his
            beard free, but the dwarf is ungrateful and yells at them for
            cutting his beautiful beard. The girls encounter the dwarf several
            times that summer, rescue him from some peril each time and the
            dwarf is ungrateful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then one day, they meet the dwarf once again. This time, he is
            terrified because the bear is about to kill him. The dwarf pleads
            with the bear and begs it to eat the girls. Instead, the bear pays
            no heed to his plea and kills the dwarf with one swipe of his paw.
            Instantly, the bear turns into a prince. The dwarf had previously
            put a spell on the prince by stealing his precious stones and
            turning him into a bear. The curse is broken with the death of the
            dwarf. Snow-White marries the prince and Rose-Red marries the
            prince's brother.
