          <h1>Once upon a time ...</h1>          
          <p>
            In order to appear superior, a miller lies to the king, telling him
            that his daughter can spin straw into gold. The king calls for the
            girl, shuts her in a tower room filled with straw and a spinning
            wheel, and demands she spin the straw into gold by morning or he
            will cut off her head. When she has given up all hope, an imp-like
            creature appears in the room and spins the straw into gold in return
            for her necklace (since he only comes to people seeking a
            deal/trade). When next morning the king takes the girl to a larger
            room filled with straw to repeat the feat, the imp once again spins,
            in return for the girl's ring. On the third day, when the girl has
            been taken to an even larger room filled with straw and told by the
            king that he will marry her if she can fill this room with gold or
            execute her if she cannot, the girl has nothing left with which she
            can pay the strange creature. He extracts from her a promise that
            she will give him her firstborn child, and so he spins the straw
            into gold a final time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The king keeps his promise to marry the miller's daughter, but when
            their first child is born, the imp returns to claim his payment:
            "Now give me what you promised." She offers him all the wealth she
            has to keep the child, but the imp has no interest in her riches.
          </p>
          <p>
            He finally consents to give up his claim to the child if she can
            guess his name within three days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her many guesses fail, but before the final night, she wanders into
            the woods searching for him and comes across his remote mountain
            cottage and watches, unseen, as he hops about his fire and sings. In
            his song's lyrics— "tonight tonight, my plans I make, tomorrow
            tomorrow, the baby I take. The queen will never win the game, for
            Rumpelstiltskin is my name"— he reveals his name.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the imp comes to the queen on the third day, after first
            feigning ignorance, she reveals his name, Rumpelstiltskin, and he
            loses his temper and their bargain. Versions vary about whether he
            accuses the devil or witches of having revealed his name to the
            queen. In the 1812 edition of the Brothers Grimm tales,
            Rumpelstiltskin then "ran away angrily, and never came back." The
            ending was revised in an 1857 edition to a more gruesome ending
            wherein Rumpelstiltskin "in his rage drove his right foot so far
            into the ground that it sank in up to his waist; then in a passion
            he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two."
            Other versions have Rumpelstiltskin driving his right foot so far
            into the ground that he creates a chasm and falls into it, never to
            be seen again. In the oral version originally collected by the
            Brothers Grimm, Rumpelstiltskin flies out of the window on a cooking
            ladle.
