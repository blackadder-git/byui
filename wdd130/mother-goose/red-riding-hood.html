        The story revolves around a girl called Little Red Riding Hood who is
        named after her red hooded cape/cloak that she wears.

          <h1>Once upon a time ...</h1>  
          <p>
            The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly
            grandmother (wine and cake depending on the translation).
          </p>
          <p>
            A Big Bad Wolf wants to eat the girl and the food in the basket. He
            secretly stalks her behind trees, bushes, shrubs, and patches of
            little and tall grass. He approaches Little Red Riding Hood, who
            naively tells him where she is going. He suggests that the girl pick
            some flowers as a present for her grandmother, which she does. In
            the meantime, he goes to the grandmother's house and gains entry by
            pretending to be her. He swallows the grandmother whole (in some
            stories, he locks her in the closet) and waits for the girl,
            disguised as the grandmother.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the girl arrives, she notices that her grandmother looks very
            strange. Little Red then says, "What a deep voice you have!" ("The
            better to greet you with", responds the wolf), "Goodness, what big
            eyes you have!" ("The better to see you with", responds the wolf),
            "And what big hands you have!" ("The better to embrace you with",
            responds the wolf), and lastly, "What a big mouth you have" ("The
            better to eat you with!", responds the wolf), at which point the
            wolf jumps out of the bed and eats her, too. Then he falls asleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            A woodcutter or hunter comes to the rescue with an axe, and cuts
            open the sleeping wolf. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother
            emerge shaken, but unharmed. Then they fill the wolf's body with
            heavy stones. The wolf awakens and attempts to flee, but the stones
            cause him to collapse and die. The wolf leaves the house and tries
            to drink out of a well, but the stones in his stomach cause him to
            fall in and drown. Sanitized versions of the story have the
            grandmother locked in the closet instead of being eaten and some
            have Little Red Riding Hood saved by the lumberjack as the wolf
            advances on her rather than after she gets eaten, where the
            woodcutter kills the wolf with his axe.

          <li>Is this the same wolf that terrorized the 3 little pigs?</li>
          <li>If so, maybe the hit against Red was targeted to disrupt her family bakery delivery business.</li>
