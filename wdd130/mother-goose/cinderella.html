          <h1>Once upon a time ...</h1>  
          <p>
            A plague infests a village, and a wealthy gentleman's wife lies on
            her deathbed. She calls for her only daughter, and tells her to
            remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is
            buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and
            a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older
            daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and
            fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters
            steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags.
            They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname
            "Aschenputtel" ("Ashfool"). She is forced to do all kinds of hard
            work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing
            but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However,
            despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and will always
            go to her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see
            her circumstances improve.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters
            gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the
            younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for
            the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes
            on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While
            passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter.
            She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her
            tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The
            girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes
            to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every
            time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.
          </p>
          <p>
            The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three
            days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend
            so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two
            sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow
            her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses
            because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl
            insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her
            to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival, if
            she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl
            accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock
            of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the
            stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater
            quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a
            greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the
            stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the
            celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver
            and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk
            shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the
            time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks
            for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince
            escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's
            pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks
            him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already
            escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return
            her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth,
            and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander
            apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when
            dark came, the prince accompany her home. However, she climbs a pear
            tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father
            who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but
            Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives
            home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with
            slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has
            the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste
            to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch.
            The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the
            maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries
            the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more
            need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by
            her mother to cut off her toes in order to fit the slipper. While
            riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the
            prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he
            goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She
            cut off part of her heel in order to get her foot in the slipper,
            and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's
            castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He
            comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him
            that his dead wife left a "dirty little Cinderella" in the house,
            omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is
            too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the
            slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and
            hands, and when she puts on the slipper, the prince recognizes her
            as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival. The
            stepmother and the two limping sisters were thunderstruck, and grew
            pale with anger. They wanted to kill Aschenputtel, but the prince
            put her before him on his horse and rode off.
