        Beauty and the Beast is interesting as it bridges the gap as a
        fantastical romance for adults and a didactic tale for children.

          <h1>Once upon a time ...</h1>  
          <p>
            A widower merchant lives in a mansion with his twelve children (six
            sons and six daughters). All of his daughters are very beautiful,
            but the youngest, Beauty, is the most lovely. She is also kind,
            well-read, and pure of heart; her elder sisters, though, are cruel,
            selfish, vain, and spoiled. On a dark and stormy night at sea, the
            merchant is robbed by pirates who sink most of his merchant fleet
            and force the entire family to live in a country house and work for
            a living. While Beauty makes a firm resolution to adjust to rural
            life with a cheerful disposition, her sisters do not and mistake her
            firmness for insensibility, forcing her into doing household work in
            an effort to make enough money to buy back their former home.
          </p>
          <p>
            A year later, the merchant hears from one of his crew members that
            one of the trade ships he had sent has arrived back in port, having
            escaped the destruction of its companions. Before leaving, he asks
            his children if they wish for him to bring any gifts back for them.
            The sons ask for weaponry and horses to hunt with, whereas the
            oldest daughters ask for clothing, jewels, and fine dresses, as they
            think his wealth has returned. Beauty asks nothing but her father's
            safety, but when he insists on buying her a present, she is
            satisfied with the promise of a rose after none had grown last
            spring. However, to his dismay, the merchant finds that his ship's
            cargo has been seized to pay his debts, leaving him penniless and
            unable to buy his children's presents.
          </p>
          <p>
            On his way back, the merchant is caught in a terrible storm. Seeking
            shelter, he comes upon a mysterious palace. The merchant sneaks in,
            seeing that nobody is home, and finds tables laden with food and
            drinks which seem to have been left for him by the palace's
            invisible owner. The merchant accepts these gifts and spends the
            night. The next morning, the merchant sees the palace as his own
            possession and is about to leave when he sees a rose garden and
            recalls that Beauty had desired a rose. The merchant quickly plucks
            the loveliest rose he can find, and is about to pluck more for a
            bouquet, but is confronted by a hideous "Beast" who warns him that
            theft of his property (i.e., the rose) is a charge punishable by
            death. Realizing his deadly mistake, the merchant begs for
            forgiveness, revealing that he had only picked the rose as a gift
            for his youngest daughter. After listening to his story, the Beast
            reluctantly agrees to let him give the rose to Beauty, but only if
            the merchant brings Beauty to him in exchange without deception; he
            makes it clear that Beauty must agree to take his place so he can
            treat her as his fiancée, and not his prisoner, while under no
            illusions about her predicament. Otherwise, the Beast will destroy
            his entire family.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, the merchant is upset about Beauty being abducted into
            marrying him, but he reluctantly accepts. The Beast sends him on his
            way atop a magical horse along with wealth, jewels and fine clothes
            for his sons and daughters, but stresses that Beauty must never know
            about his deal. The merchant, upon arriving home, tries to hide the
            secret from his children, but Beauty pries it from him on purpose.
            Reacting swiftly, the brothers suggest they could go to the castle
            and fight the Beast together while the older sisters place blame on
            Beauty for dooming the entire family. To release her father from the
            engagement, Beauty volunteers to go to the Beast willingly, and her
            father reluctantly allows her to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once she arrives at his palace, the Beast is excited to meet Beauty
            face to face, so he throws a welcome ceremony by treating her to an
            amazing cabaret. He gives her lavish clothing and food and carries
            on lengthy conversations with her in which she notes that he is
            inclined to stupidity rather than savagery. Every night, the Beast
            asks Beauty to sleep with him, only to be refused each time. After
            each refusal, Beauty dreams of dancing with a handsome prince.
            Suddenly, a fairy appears and pleads with Beauty to say why she
            keeps refusing him. She replies that she doesn't know how to love
            the Beast because she loves him only as a friend. Despite the
            apparition of the fairy urging her not to be deceived by
            appearances, she does not make the connection between a "prince" and
            a "beast" and becomes convinced that the Beast is holding the Prince
            captive somewhere in his castle. She searches and discovers many
            enchanted rooms ranging from libraries to aviaries to enchanted
            windows allowing her to attend the theater. She also finds live
            furniture and other live objects which act as servants, but never
            the Prince from her dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a month, Beauty lives a life of luxury at the Beast's palace
            with no end to riches or amusements and an endless supply of
            exquisite finery to wear. Eventually, she becomes homesick and begs
            the Beast to allow her to go see her family again. He allows it on
            the condition that she returns in exactly two months. Beauty agrees
            to this and is presented with an enchanted ring which will take her
            back to the Beast when the two months are up. The rest of her family
            is surprised to find her well fed and dressed in finery. At first,
            her father advises Beauty to marry the Beast, but when Beauty
            refuses, her father and her brothers do all they can to detain her
            return to the Beast. However, Beauty is determined to honor the deal
            she made.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the two months are almost up, Beauty begins hallucinating the
            Beast lying dead in his quarters and uses her ring to return to the
            Beast. Once she is back in the castle, Beauty's fears are confirmed
            as she finds out that the Beast died of shame due to her choice of
            staying with her family permanently after her first trip to his
            castle. Completely devastated over the wrong choice she made, Beauty
            bursts into tears and laments that she should have learned how to
            love the Beast in the first place, screaming, "I am sorry! This was
            all my fault!". Suddenly, when she says those words, the Beast is
            transformed into the handsome prince from Beauty's dreams. The
            Prince informs her that long ago, a powerful
            enchantress(fantasy)enchantress turned him into a hideous beast for
            his selfishness after trying to seduce him and that only by finding
            true love, despite his ugliness, could the curse be broken. He and
            Beauty are married and they live happily ever after.
