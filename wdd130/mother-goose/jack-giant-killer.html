          <h1>Once upon a time ...</h1>  
          <p>
            The tale is set during the reign of King Arthur and tells of a young
            Cornish farmer's son named Jack who is not only strong but so clever
            he easily confounds the learned with his penetrating wit. Jack
            encounters a livestock-eating giant called Cormoran and lures him to
            his death in a pit trap. Jack is dubbed 'Jack the Giant-Killer' for
            this feat and receives not only the giant's wealth, but a sword and
            belt to commemorate the event.
          </p>
          <p>
            A man-eating giant named Blunderbore vows vengeance for Cormoran's
            death and carries Jack off to an enchanted castle. Jack manages to
            slay Blunderbore and his brother Rebecks by hanging and stabbing
            them. He frees three ladies held captive in the giant's castle.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a trip into Wales, Jack tricks a two-headed Welsh giant into
            slashing his own belly open. King Arthur's son now enters the story
            and Jack becomes his servant.
          </p>
          <p>
            They spend the night with a three-headed giant and rob him in the
            morning. In gratitude for having spared his castle, the three-headed
            giant gives Jack a magic sword, a cap of knowledge, a cloak of
            invisibility, and shoes of swiftness.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the road, Jack and the Prince meet an enchanted Lady serving
            Lucifer. Jack breaks the spell with his magic accessories, beheads
            Lucifer, and the Lady marries the Prince. Jack is rewarded with
            membership in the Round Table.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jack ventures forth alone with his magic shoes, sword, cloak, and
            cap to rid the realm of troublesome giants. He encounters a giant
            terrorizing a knight and his lady. He cuts off the giant's legs,
            then puts him to death. He discovers the giant's companion in a
            cave. Invisible in his cloak, Jack cuts off the giant's nose then
            slays him by plunging his sword into the monster's back. He frees
            the giant's captives and returns to the house of the knight and lady
            he earlier had rescued.
          </p>
          <p>
            A banquet is prepared, but it is interrupted by the two-headed giant
            Thunderdel chanting "Fee, fau, fum". Jack defeats and beheads the
            giant with a trick involving the house's moat and drawbridge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing weary of the festivities, Jack sallies forth for more
            adventures and meets an elderly man who directs him to an enchanted
            castle belonging to the giant Galligantus (Galligantua, in the
            Joseph Jacobs version). The giant holds captive many knights and
            ladies and a Duke's daughter who has been transformed into a white
            doe through the power of a sorcerer. Jack beheads the giant, the
            sorcerer flees, the Duke's daughter is restored to her true shape,
            and the captives are freed.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the court of King Arthur, Jack marries the Duke's daughter and
            the two are given an estate where they live happily ever after.
