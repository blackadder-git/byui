          <h1>Once upon a time ...</h1>  
          <p>
            In early spring, a butterfly decides that he wants to marry a
            flower. He does not know, however, which flower he should choose as
            his bride. Knowing that people use daisies to tell their fortunes,
            pulling off the petals while saying, "He loves me. He loves me not",
            the butterfly concludes that daisies must be able to see into the
            future. In order to save time wooing several different flowers, the
            butterfly asks a daisy which flower is destined to be his bride. He
            asks three times but the daisy does not answer him.
          </p>

          <p>
            Having received no help from the daisy, the butterfly decides to
            start courting the flowers. He decides that none of the flowers he
            can see would make suitable wives because they are too formal, too
            sour, too sentimental, too small, too similar to other flowers or
            simply not attractive enough for him. He considers marrying the
            apple blossom but decides against it. He fears that the marriage
            could be a very short one because the blossom could easily be
            carried away by the wind. He likes the pea blossom very much, until
            he sees her sister, a withered old pea pod.
          </p>

          <p>
            The butterfly has still not chosen a wife by the time that autumn
            comes. By that time, most of the flowers have lost their fragrance.
            The butterfly then notices the mint plant. Although it has no
            flowers, the mint plant smells pleasant all over. The butterfly asks
            the mint plant to marry him. The mint plant replies that their
            wedding would look ridiculous because both she and the butterfly are
            now too old to get married. She agrees to be friends with the
            butterfly but nothing more. After this rejection, the butterfly does
            not ask any other plants to marry him.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the weather gets worse, the butterfly takes refuge inside a room
            that is heated by a stove. He is happy for a while, until he begins
            to miss the sunshine and the company of flowers. He flies towards a
            windowpane. It is then that he is noticed by the people of the
            house. He is stuck on a pin and put in a box. He has some potted
            plants for company but he does not trust them because he thinks they
            are too friendly towards humans. He consoles himself by thinking
            that he is in a position similar to being tied down, and therefore
            similar to being married.
