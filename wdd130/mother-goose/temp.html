      Sing a Song of Six Pence
      Sing a song of sixpence,
      A pocket full of rye,
      Four and twenty blackbirds
      Baked in a pie.

      When the pie was opened
      The birds began to sing—
      Wasn't that a dainty dish
      To set before the king?

      The king was in the counting-house
      Counting out his money,
      The queen was in the parlor
      Eating bread and honey,

      The maid was in the garden
      Hanging out the clothes.
      Along came a blackbird
      And snipped off her nose.

      That looks after the sheep?
      He's under the haystack,
      fast a-sleep.
