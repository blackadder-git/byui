          <h1>Once upon a time ...</h1>  
          <p>
            A king and queen had a beautiful daughter, Graciosa, and an ugly
            duchess hated her. One day, the queen died. The king grieved so much
            that his doctors ordered him to hunt. Weary, he stopped at the
            duchess's castle and discovered how rich she was. He agreed to marry
            her even though she demanded control of her stepdaughter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The princess was reasoned into behaving well by her nurse. A
            handsome young page, Percinet, appeared. He was a rich young prince
            with a fairy gift, and he was in her service. He gave her a horse to
            ride to greet the duchess. It made the duchess's look ugly, and she
            demanded it, and that Percinet led it as he led it for Graciosa.
            Nevertheless, the horse ran away, and her disarray made her look
            even uglier. The duchess had Graciosa beaten with rods, except that
            the rods were turned into peacock feathers, and she suffered no
            harm.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wedding went on, and the king arranged a tournament to flatter
            the queen. The king's knights overthrew all the challengers, for all
            the ugliness of the queen, until a young challenger overthrew them
            and showed the portrait of the princess as the most beautiful woman
            in the world. The queen had her abandoned in the woods. Percinet
            rescued her, but she wished to return to her father, and when
            Percinet showed her how the queen had claimed her dead and buried a
            log of wood in her place, she insisted. He told her that she would
            never see his castle again until she was buried.
          </p>
          <p>
            The king was glad to see her, but when the queen returned and
            insisted, he seemed convinced that Graciosa was an imposter. The
            queen imprisoned her, and with the aid of a wicked fairy, set her to
            disentangle a skein, on pain of her life. Graciosa thought Percinet
            would not aid her, but finally in despair called on him, and he
            disentangled it. The outraged queen set her to sort a room filled
            with feathers, and Percinet did that as well. Then the queen set her
            to bring a box to her own castle, and forbad her to open it.
            Curiosity got the better of her, and Graciosa freed a swarm of
            little men and women whom she could not get back in. Percinet helped
            her. The servants would not admit Graciosa, but gave her a letter
            telling they would not let her in.
          </p>
          <p>
            The queen suggested that they lift a stone in the garden, which
            covered a well, on the grounds she had heard it covered a treasure.
            When it was up, she pushed Graciosa in, and dropped the stone.
            Percinet and his mother rescued her, and this time, Graciosa agreed
            to marry him.
