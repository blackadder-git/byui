                        moving firefly text and a campfire that was made entirely out of CSS animations. In addition, I learned to use SASS.

                        This was a project with specific requirements to build a JavaScript app that could add 
                        items to a list, remove them, mark them as complete, and also filter them for the user.

                        As with other projects, I used the console to debug my app during development. Having learned
                        to use the localstorage object, I can now think of many projects that would benefit from being able to 
                        save information between sessions.

                        The objective of this project was to create a fictitious site for a local chamber of commerce. In addition to meeting 
                        industry standards, the site needed to implement wayfinding, multiple forms, follow PARC principles (proximity, alignment,
                        repetition, contrast), and use a REST api to collect weather information. In addition, the css and js needed to be minimized
                        and images optimized.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In addition to building the site, I had fun collecting the images which are local to where I live.

                    <li>Your page layouts may not be an exact replication of your weather site in terms of layout style</li>
                    <li>Your site must meet the specifications listed on the 230 Web Frontend Development Standards page</li>
                    <li>Structure the site with valid, standards-based, semantic markup that is responsive to small, medium and large screen views without violating PARC principles</li>
                    <li>Style with valid CSS that does not contain unused and unnecessary (duplicate) declarations nor different selector notations for the same element</li>
                    <li>Ensure that all browsers render elements consistently by referencing a normalization or reset CSS on all pages</li>
                    <li>Design a logo to be used at appropriate levels and locations throughout the website</li>
                    <li>Follow PARC principles and typography best-practices throughout the website</li>
                    <li>Implement an appropriate font of your choice, using a Google Fonts reference or equivalent resource</li>
                    <li>Use the practice of wayfinding to improve the user experience of understanding where a user is on the website</li>
                    <li>Use JavaScript as needed including driving the content of the business directory page from your own JSON file</li>

                        The objective of this project was to create a responsive site with pages for individual cities. Current weather conditions

                        For this project I used the Chrome developer tools and Lighthouse to optimize the page performance and quality. In addition

                        The objective of this project was to create a responsive site with at least three pages. One of the pages needed to 
                        include a form. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using public images and content, I constructed a site around stories and their hyphothesized meaning
                        I included CSS rollover effects on the images, a form to showcase multiple inputs and.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For me the highlight was getting the evidence board to work correctly with jQuery and a 3rd-party library.

                        The objective of this project was to create a sudoku solver with a menu that would allow a user to select
                        options to see the menu, display the board, edit a square, exit. In addition, extra credit was offered if the 
                        program could solve the puzzle on its own. Once I had the game working, I looked into using backtracing to
                        complete the game. While this would work, it took a while for the program to solve the board. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I decided to look into how a human being might approach a sudoku puzzle. I soon learned about techniques 
                        such as <a href="https://sudoku.com/sudoku-rules/hidden-singles/">hidden singles</a>, <a href="https://sudoku.com/sudoku-rules/hidden-pairs/">hidden pairs</a>,
                        and <a href="https://sudoku.com/sudoku-rules/pointing-pairs/">pointing pairs</a>. I implemented these search
                        techniques into my program with a temporary board and found that the puzzles were solved much quicker.

                    <!--li>Not all Sudoku boards are created equal. Some are much more difficult to solve than others. You will get awarded points according to the level of difficulty of the board you are able to solve. The boards are:<br>

                    <li>You will need to add another item on the menu to allow the user to select that they want to solve the board. You can name this menu item anything you want. In fact, because there is no testBed for this challenge, feel free to make any adjustments to the user interface you want</li>
                    <li>"Robust" error checking. Every possible input or board configuration is handled. For example, the user could type "e5" or "5E" to specify a square. Also, the board is validated on open to ensure it is a valid board This means ensuring that there is no more than one instance of each value in a given row, column, or inside square</li>
                    <li>Differentiate read-only values (the ones provided by the board that the user cannot change) and read/write values (the ones the user entered). Read-only text will be rendered in green. The following example outputs green text for the word "green"</li>
                    <li>Enforce the rules of Sudoku. This means that there can be only one instance of a given number on a row, column, or inside square</li>
                    <li>Create a program that performs six operations:<br>
                        Read: Read a board from a file into our board[][] array<br>
                        Write: Write the board[] array back to a file<br>
                        'D' Option: Display the contents of the board[][] array on the screen<br>
                        'E' Option: Edit a square with no verification that it is correct or valid<br>
                        'Q' Option: Exit the interaction loop and launches the Write code<br>
                        '?' Option: Displays the instructions on the screen
