* Naming
** The Java language began life as the JDK. Later, the name was changed to J2SE to reflect significant changes e.g. v2 while the SE represented Standard Edition vs EE Enterprise Edition and ME Micro Edition. Three releases later, the name was changed yet again to Java SE
** Java 20 is the latest version while Java 17, 11 and 8 are current long term support versions
** [Java version history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history)

** Main componenets
* JVM (Java Virtual Machine) - converts byte code to machine-specific code
* JRE (Java Runtime Environment) - includes the JVM, binaries and classes needed to execute a Java program
* JDK (Java Development Kit) - includes the JVM along with tools, executables, binaries required to compile, debug and execute a Java program

** What should I download?
* JRE to run program only
* JDK to build programs
* OpenJDK (GPL, free to run, develop and distribute) [Download](https://openjdk.org/)
* AdoptOpenJDK Prebuil[Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/)
* Amazon Corretto [Download](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/)
* Oracle (free for personal use, development, testing, prototyping but not for redistribution) [License](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jre8-readme.html) [Downloads](https://www.java.com/en/) Java 8 is the last no cost version from Oracle
