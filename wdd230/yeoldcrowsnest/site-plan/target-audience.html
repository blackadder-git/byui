            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The majority of participants who will use this site fall into one of two 
                categories.  
            </p>
            <p>The first group, defined as reenactors, are mostly hobbiests. They fall into three categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Farbs - place emphasis on the overall experience rather than authenticity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mainstream - make an effort to appear authentic but may appear out of character
                    when an audience is not present.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Progressives - value research and seek an immersive experience that is a close
                    to the original experience as possible.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Overall, reenactors are interested in getting their informaiton out to the community. They want
                to inform the public of upcoming events and shows. Reenactors enjoy educating others and may 
                seek employment opportunities in period films and documentaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second group of users includes those who wish to learn more about the history
                of piracy. These individuals are interested in experiencing past narratives in an immersive way.
                They may be researching the topic for school or work or simple to learn more about this 
                subject.

                        Cameron is a 28 year old college student working on his final project in film school. He
                        works part time as a waiter to support his education and with any free time that he has, 
                        Cameron likes to watch classic black and white movies. His current project is a swashbuckling
                        epic and has been made with mostly friends and family. To complete his project, Cameron has 
                        written a climactic fight scene involving over 100 actors. He now needs a website to find them.

                        Becka is a 32 year old mother of six children. She has next to no free time but gets support
                        from her family to indulge her passion for live history; specifically pirate history. The group
                        Becka joined is in need of information to help them prepare for an upcoming event.  Becka needs
                        to know what the weather will be like in order to inform her crew as to how they should dress.

                        Cameron is making a video for his film class. He is on a shoestring budget but
                        needs a motley band of pirates to film the final sequence. He decides the best 
                        way to get the shots he needs and stay under budget is to hire extras that can bring
                        their own propts and costumes. Cameron looks over the different groups on 
                        Ye Old Crow's Nest and messages several to schedule some one-on-one meetings 
                        to discuss his specific requirements.

                        Madison wants to learn more about the golden age of piracy.  Although she has gone
                        to wikipedia and several other sites for information; yet what she really wants is to 
                        experience the life of a pirate. Checking the events section, Madison learns there is 
                        a festival "Treasure Island 2021" scheduled to take place in Fish Haven, Idaho.  Madison
                        signs up for more information and happily marks her calendar.

                        KJ and his friends just got back from a trip to Soda Springs, Idaho. Unfortunately
                        during all the activity, KJ lost his camera. Luckily, KJ made some friends on the trip
                        who posted their pictures to the gallery on this site. KJ is able to recover many of
                        of the memories he and his friends made and share them with his friends and family at home.

                        Becka's reenactment troupe is scheduled to perform in Preston, Idaho later today.
                        Tasked with letting her group know what the weather will be like in order
                        for the team to dress appropriately, Becka checks the weather forecast on the site
                        and sees it is mostly cloudy with a 24% chance of rain.  Her group won't need to bring
                        sunscreen. Instead, Becka messages everyone and suggests they bring an umbrella.

                        Amanda is an aspiring writer.  She wants to build her portfolio and decides to write
                        several short biographies on the lives of several known pirates.  Her work is well 
                        recieved by the Crow's Nest community and along with some historical correction 
                        Amanda gains the confidence to begin work on a fictictious novel entitled, "RoseBee McPegLeg"
                        about the misadventures of a good natured yet traviesa heroine pirate.
